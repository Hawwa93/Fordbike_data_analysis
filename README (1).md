# New York Bike Sharing ExploratoryData Analysis
## by Hauwa Musa Hameed

## Dataset
>The "New York Bike Sharing" dataset provides information on bike sharing usage in New York. The purpose of this project is to investigate the factors that drive participation in the bike sharing system. The dataset includes information on various attributes such as duration of the trip, longitude and latitude of each station, start and end time, start and end station names, user type, member gender, bike share type, day of the trip, age, start time hour, and age group. With a total of 183412 observations and 16 attributes, the data provides insights about the usage patterns of the bike sharing system. Before my exploratory analysis, I carried out some preliminary wrangling on the data set such as droping null values, and some feature engineering( creating otherr columns).


## Summary of Findings

> After a carefull analysis of the NewYork bike sharing data set, I was able to find trends and patterns and also discovered some of the factors that affects the bike sharing system. factors like age, gender, affect the usage of the bikes and the male genders are the predominant users. Most users fall between the age of 25 to 45 and are more of subcribers than customers  and most of the bikes are not likely to be shared during the trips. The bikes are used more using weekdays and less during weekends, and the start time is at its peak by 8-9am and 4-5pm during the day

## Key Insights for Presentation

> the key insights for my presentation include:
* Age range of most of the bike users; The age range of most of the bike users falls between the age of 25 to 45 years and the median age is 35
* The bikes are mostly used during the weekdays and less during the weekends
* The bike usage is at its peak at 8:00-9:00am and 4:00 - 5:00 pm
